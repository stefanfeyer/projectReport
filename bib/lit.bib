abstract = {We present a hybrid classification method applicable to gesture recognition. The method combines elements of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and various Dynamic Programming Alignment (DPA) methods, such as edit distance, sequence alignment, and dynamic time warping. As opposed to existing approaches which treat HMM and DPA as either competing or complementing methods, we provide a common framework which allows us to combine ideas from both HMM and DPA research. The combined approach takes on the robustness and effectiveness of HMMs and the simplicity of DPA approaches. We have implemented and successfully tested the proposed algorithm on various gesture data.},

abstract = {Abstract In this research, the authors evaluate the degree to which dancers copy or follow the techniques of a master, or the degree of proficiency, by analyzing movements in traditional Japanese dance. The data used consist of three-dimensional time series for traditional Japanese dance movements acquired using optical motion capture system. In the authors' prior research, three moving coordinate systems which would move according to the translation and rotation of the body were used to extract the portion of the target movement. In this research, the authors consider a moving coordinate system which simultaneously takes into consideration translation, rotation, correction of orientation, and correction of waist tremble. In their prior research, the authors defined indices for movement stability and frequency characteristics as indices to quantitatively represent in an objective fashion the degree of proficiency of a dancer. Separate from this, in the current research the authors define an index with the spectrum component using a Gabor transform and an index for the amount of translation. The authors had a total of five people, a master from a particular dance school and four dance students of different genders and at different experience levels (all the master's students), perform dance experiments. The authors then extracted the target movements, measured the indices using the extraction results, and attempted to evaluate the degree of proficiency based on the proposed indices. Extraction was sufficiently precise, and the authors were able to confirm that the indices represent the differences appearing due to degree of proficiency and gender. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {This paper presents a multimodal system capable to understand and correct in real-time the movements of Tai-Chi students through the integration of audio-visual-tactile technologies. This platform acts like a virtual teacher that transfers the knowledge of five Tai-Chi movements using feed-back stimuli to compensate the errors committed by a user during the performance of the gesture. The fundamental components of this multimodal interface are the gesture recognition system (using k-means clustering, Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) and Finite State Machines (FSM)) and the real-time descriptor of motion which is used to compute and qualify the actual movements performed by the student respect to the movements performed by the master, obtaining several feedbacks and compensating this movement in real-time varying audio-visualtactile parameters of different devices. The experiments of this multimodal platform have confirmed that the quality of the movements performed by the students is improved significantly.},

abstract = {A carefully planned, structured, and supervised physiotherapy program, following a surgery, is crucial for the successful diagnosis of physical injuries. Nearly 50 {\%} of the surgeries fail due to unsupervised, and erroneous physiotherapy. The demand for a physiotherapist for an extended period is expensive to afford, and sometimes inaccessible. Researchers have tried to leverage the advancements in wearable sensors and motion tracking by building affordable, automated, physio-therapeutic systems that direct a physiotherapy session by providing audio-visual feedback on patient's performance. There are many aspects of automated physiotherapy program which are yet to be addressed by the existing systems: a wide classification of patients' physiological conditions to be diagnosed, multiple demographics of the patients (blind, deaf, etc.), and the need to pursue patients to adopt the system for an extended period for self-care. In our research, we have tried to address these aspects by building a health behavior change support system called KinoHaptics, for post-surgery rehabilitation. KinoHaptics is an automated, wearable, haptic assisted, physio-therapeutic system that can be used by a wide variety of demographics and for various physiological conditions of the patients. The system provides rich and accurate vibro-haptic feedback that can be felt by the user, irrespective of the physiological limitations. KinoHaptics is built to ensure that no injuries are induced during the rehabilitation period. The persuasive nature of the system allows for personal goal-setting, progress tracking, and most importantly life-style compatibility. The system was evaluated under laboratory conditions, involving 14 users. Results show that KinoHaptics is highly convenient to use, and the vibro-haptic feedback is intuitive, accurate, and has shown to prevent accidental injuries. Also, results show that KinoHaptics is persuasive in nature as it supports behavior change and habit building. The successful acceptance of KinoHaptics, an automated, wearable, haptic assisted, physio-therapeutic system proves the need and future-scope of automated physio-therapeutic systems for self-care and behavior change. It also proves that such systems incorporated with vibro-haptic feedback encourage strong adherence to the physiotherapy program; can have profound impact on the physiotherapy experience resulting in higher acceptance rate.},

Observation is the very first step to copy the motion of instructor when at the beginning of learning sports of artisanship. However, beginners face difficulties in imitating at the start since they do not have somesthetic image of the movement. In order to help learning physical skills, we propose Immersive virtual environment using head mounted display that indicates 3D motion of instructor super imposed on learner's body. By using this system, learners try to match its own form to instructor's 3D model to imitate instructor's motion from first person view in virtual environment. At the early stage of this research, we tried to transfer pitching skill in baseball. We evaluated the effectiveness of proposed system by measuring throwing distance.},

abstract = {Most of us have marveled at one time or another about how highly skilled performers in industry, sport, music, or dance seem to make their actions appear so simple and easy, performed with incredible efficiency, smoothness, style, and grace. Like the first three editions (Schmidt, 1982,1988; Schmidt {\&} Lee, 1999), the fourth edition of Motor Control and Learning: A Behavioral Emphasis was written for those who would like to understand how it is that these performers can achieve such artistry while we, as beginners in a similar task, are clumsy, inept, and unskilled. This book was written particularly as a textbook for university or college undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in human performance or motor learning, primarily in fields such as kinesiology or psychology. Students in other fields such as the neurosciences, physical and occupational therapy, biomedical or industrial engineering, and human factors/ergonomics will also find many of the concepts contained here to be of interest, as movement behavior is a part of all of them. And for those who are (or are becoming) practitioners in these fields, the principles of motor behavior outlined here should provide a solid basis for tasks such as designing human-machine systems, developing training programs in sport or industry, or teaching progressions in dance or music. The book is divided into three parts. Part I provides an introduction to research and fundamental concepts that are important to understanding motor behavior; Part II deals with motor control; and Part III deals with the acquisition of skill, or motor learning.

abstract = {We present a study of collaborative dancing between remote dancers in a tele-immersive environment which features 3D full and real body capturing, wide field of view, multi-display 3D rendering, and attachment free participant. We invite two professional dancers to perform collaborative dancing in the environment. The coordination requires one dancer to take the lead while the other follows by appropriate movement. Throughout the experiment, the dancers are dancing at various motion rates to evaluate how well the collaborative dancing is supported with the current technical boundary. Our important findings indicate that 1) tele-immersive environments have strong potential impact on the concept of choreography and communication of live dance performance, 2) the presence of multi-view display, real body 3D rendering, audio channel, and less intrusiveness greatly enhances the immersive and dancing experience, and 3) the level of synchronization achieved by the dancers is higher than that expected from the video rate.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a technique to automatically synthesize dancing motions for arbitrary songs with dance beats. Our technique is based on analysing a musical tune (can be a song or melody) and synthesizing a motion for the virtual character where the character's movement synchronizes to the musical beats. In order to analyse beats of the tune, we developed a fast algorithm. Our motion synthesis algorithm analyses library of stock motions and generates new sequences of movements that were not described in the library. We show that our motion synthesis algorithm is better than previous dance generation techniques. We also present two algorithms to synchronize dance moves and musical beats: a fast greedy algorithm, and a genetic algorithm. Our experimental results show that we can generate new sequences of dance figures in which the dancer reacts to music and dances in synchronization with the music.},

This process is usually based on an educational system or in any other kind of face-to-face tradition. However, developing countries usually face a lack of well educated people so that this process is hindered. This is even more problematic for countries having recently struggled through times of war. Hence, we apply a community-centered approach to capturing expert knowledge in non-linear digital stories and repurposing it in the shape of educational games.

abstract = {" Like the overlap in a Venn diagram, shared kinesthetic and intellectual constructs from the field of dance and the field of technology will reinforce and enhance one another, resulting in an ultimately deepened experience for both viewer and performer. " -Alyssa Schoeneman Abstract With the rise of the digital age, dancers and choreog-raphers started looking for new ways to connect with younger audiences who were left disengaged from tra-ditional dance productions. This led to the growing pop-ularity of multimedia performances where digitally pro-jected spaces appear to be influenced by dancers' move-ments. Unfortunately current approaches, such as re-liance on pre-rendered videos, merely create the illusion of interaction with dancers, when in fact the dancers are actually closely synchronized with the multimedia display to create the illusion. This calls for unprece-dented accuracy of movement and timing on the part of the dancers, which increases cost and rehearsal time, as well as greatly limits the dancers' creative expression. We propose the first truly interactive solution for inte-grating digital spaces into dance performance: ViFlow. Our approach is simple, cost effective, and fully interac-tive in real-time, allowing the dancers to retain full free-dom of movement and creative expression. In addition, our system eliminates reliance on a technical expert. A movement-based language enables choreographers to directly interact with ViFlow, empowering them to inde-pendently create fully interactive, live augmented real-ity productions.},

abstract = {Traditionally, when people want to learn martial arts, they have to go to training clubs and learn under the coach together with the other students. To reduce the tuition fees, there are usually a lot of students under a single coach and hence, it is difficult for the students to get enough suggestions in the class. It would be far easier if the students could practice themselves at home and ask for suggestions from a virtual coach in the computer. Occasionally, in case they find difficulties going to the next step, they may then approach the real coach for suggestions and training. In this paper, we propose such a training system based on the motion capture system. The system automatically analyzes the motions of the player and gives suggestions. The students can also view the martial art techniques stored in the system or their own techniques captured by the motion capture system from various points of view in order to gain objective ideas of the techniques.},

abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Physiologic turnover of interstitial collagen is mediated by a sequential pathway in which collagen is fragmented by pericellular collagenases, endocytosed by collagen receptors, and routed to lysosomes for degradation by cathepsins. Here, we use intravital microscopy to investigate if malignant tumors, which are characterized by high rates of extracellular matrix turnover, utilize a similar collagen degradation pathway. Tumors of epithelial, mesenchymal, or neural crest origin all display vigorous endocytic collagen degradation. The cells engaged in this process are identified as tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-like cells that degrade collagen in a mannose receptor-dependent manner. Accordingly, mannose-receptor-deficient mice display increased intratumoral collagen. Whole-transcriptome profiling uncovers a distinct extracellular matrix-catabolic signature of these collagen-degrading TAMs. Lineage-ablation studies reveal that collagen-degrading TAMs originate from circulating CCR2+ monocytes. This study identifies a function of TAMs in altering the tumor microenvironment through endocytic collagen turnover and establishes macrophages as centrally engaged in tumor-associated collagen degradation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this paper we discuss the challenges of creating interfaces to simulate a sport like boxing for an immersive space. We also discuss the philosophy that influences the game play, and followed by the detail of implementation. We argue that the unique design of the game make it an experience that can only be experienced in a fully immersive environment like the C6.},

abstract = {One of the challenging issues in affective computing is to give a machine the ability to recognize the mood of a person. Efforts in that direction have mainly focused on facial and oral cues. Gestures have been recently considered as well, but with less success. Our aim is to fill this gap by identifying and measuring the saliency of posture features that play a role in affective expression. As a case study, we collected affective gestures from human subjects using a motion capture system. We first described these gestures with spatial features, as suggested in studies on dance. Through standard statistical techniques, we verified that there was a statistically significant correlation between the emotion intended by the acting subjects, and the emotion perceived by the observers. We used Discriminant Analysis to build affective posture predictive models and to measure the saliency of the proposed set of posture features in discriminating between 4 basic emotional states: angry, fear, happy, and sad. An information theoretic characterization of the models shows that the set of features discriminates well between emotions, and also that the models built over-perform the human observers.},

abstract = {Mind-maps have been widely neglected by the information retrieval (IR) community. However, there are an estimated two million active mind-map users, who create 5 million mind-maps every year, of which a total of 300,000 is publicly available. We believe this to be a rich source for information retriev- al applications, and present eight ideas on how mind-maps could be utilized by them. For instance, mind-maps could be utilized to generate user models for recommender systems or expert search, or to calculate relatedness of web-pages that are linked in mind-maps. We evaluated the feasibility of the eight ideas, based on estimates of the number of available mind-maps, an analysis of the content of mind-maps, and an evaluation of the users' acceptance of the ideas. We concluded that user modelling is the most promising application with re- spect to mind-maps. A user modelling prototype – a recommender system for the users of our mind-mapping software Docear – was implemented, and evalu- ated. Depending on the applied user modelling approaches, the effectiveness, i.e. click-through rate on recommendations, varied between 0.28{\%} and 6.24{\%}. This indicates that mind-map based user modelling is promising, but not trivial, and that further research is required to increase effectiveness.},

abstract = {The evaluation of recommender systems is key to the successful application of recommender systems in practice. To evaluate recommender systems, there are three evaluation methods: offline evaluations, online evaluations, and user studies. In this paper, we examine and discuss the appropriateness of the three methods. Among others, we use the three methods to evaluate a number of recommendations approaches in the field of research paper recommendations. The evaluations show that results from offline evaluations sometimes contradict results from online evaluations and user studies. We discuss potential reasons for this, namely the impact of human factors, the potential inherent value of offline evaluations, and the imperfection of offline-datasets, and we conclude that offline evaluations probably are not suitable to evaluate recommender systems, particularly in the domain of research paper recommender systems. We further analyze and discuss the appropriateness of some online evaluation metrics such as click-through rate, link- through rate, and cite-through rate. We conclude that click-through is the most favorable metric, at least in our research, since metrics such as cite-through rate did correlate less well with user satisfaction than click- through rate.},

Sketching, prototyping, and design are essential parts of the process we use to create new products. Bill Buxton brings design leadership and creativity to Microsoft. Through his thought-provoking personal examples he is inspiring others to better understand the role of design in their own companies--Bill Gates, Chairman, Microsoft{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Informed design is essential. While it might seem that Bill Buxton is exaggerating or kidding with this bold assertion, neither is the case. In an impeccably argued and sumptuously illustrated book, design star Buxton convinces us that design simply must be integrated into the heart of business--Roger Martin, Dean, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Design is explained, with the means and manner for successes and failures illuminated by engaging stories, true examples and personal anecdotes. In Sketching User Experiences, Bill Buxton clarifies the processes and skills of design from sketching to experience modeling, in a lively and informative style that is rich with stories and full of his own heart and enthusiasm. At the start we are lost in mountain snows and northern seas, but by the end we are equipped with a deep understanding of the tools of creative design.--Bill Moggridge, Cofounder of IDEO and author of Designing Interactions{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}I love this book. There are very few resources available that see across and through all of the disciplines involved in developing great experiences.

Nevertheless, Bill manages to skilfully steer a course between the excesses of the two approaches and offers something truly in-between. It could be a real boon to the innovation business by bringing the best of both worlds: design and HCI. --Richard Harper, Microsoft Research, Cambridge{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}There is almost a fervor in the way that new products, with their rich and dynamic interfaces, are being released to the publictypically promising to make lives easier, solve the most difficult of problems, and maybe even make the world a better place. The reality is that few survive, much less deliver on their promise. The folly? An absence of design, and an over-reliance on technology alone as the solution.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}We need design. But design as described here depends on different skillsetseach essential, but on their own, none sufficient. In this rich ecology, designers are faced with new challengeschallenges that build on, rather than replace, existing skills and practice. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Sketching User Experiences approaches design and design thinking as something distinct that needs to be better understoodby both designers and the people with whom they need to work in order to achieve success with new products and systems. So while the focus is on design, the approach is holistic. Hence, the book speaks to designers, usability specialists, the HCI community, product managers, and business executives. There is an emphasis on balancing the back-end concern with usability and engineering excellence (getting the design right) with an up-front investment in sketching and ideation (getting the right design). Overall, the objective is to build the notion of informed design: molding emerging technology into a form that serves our society and reflects its values. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Grounded in both practice and scientific research, Bill Buxtons engaging work aims to spark the imagination while encouraging the use of new techniques, breathing new life into user experience design.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Covers sketching and early prototyping design methods suitable for dynamic product capabilities: cell phones that communicate with each other and other embedded systems, smart appliances, and things you only imagine in your dreams;{\textless}br{\textgreater} Thorough coverage of the design sketching method which helps easily build experience prototypeswithout the effort of engineering prototypes which are difficult to abandon;{\textless}br{\textgreater} Reaches out to a range of designers, including user interface designers, industrial designers, software engineers, usability engineers, product managers, and others;{\textless}br{\textgreater} Full of case studies, examples, exercises, and projects, and access to video clips that demonstrate the principles and methods.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}About the Author{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Trained as a musician, Bill Buxton began using computers over thirty years ago in his art. This early experience, both in the studio an on stage, helped develop a deep appreciation of both the positive and negative aspects of technology and its impact. This increasingly drew him into both design and research, with a very strong emphasis on interaction and the human aspects of technology. He first came to prominence for his work at the University of Toronto on digital musical instruments and the novel interfaces that they employed. This work in the late 70s gained the attention of Xerox PARC, where Buxton participated in pioneering work in collaborative work, interaction techniques and ubiquitous computing. He then went on to become Chief Scientist of SGI and Alias|Wavefront, where he had the opportunity to work with some of the top film makers and industrial designers in the world. He is now a principal researcher at Microsoft Corp., where he splits his time between research and helping make design a fundamental pillar of the corporate culture.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}* Covers sketching and early prototyping design methods suitable for dynamic product capabilities: cell phones that communicate with each other and other embedded systems, smart appliances, and things you only imagine in your dreams;{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}* Thorough coverage of the design sketching method which helps easily build experience prototypeswithout the effort of engineering prototypes which are difficult to abandon;{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}* Reaches out to a range of designers, including user interface designers, industrial designers, software engineers, usability engineers, product managers, and others;{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}* Full of case studies, examples, exercises, and projects, and access to video clips that demonstrate the principles and methods.},

abstract = {This article presents nearly 10 year's worth of System Usability Scale (SUS) data collected on numerous products in all phases of the development lifecycle. The SUS, developed by Brooke (1996), reflected a strong need in the usability community for a tool that could quickly and easily collect a user's subjective rating of a product's usability. The data in this study indicate that the SUS fulfills that need. Results from the analysis of this large number of SUS scores show that the SUS is a highly robust and versatile tool for usability professionals. The article presents these results and discusses their implications, describes nontraditional uses of the SUS, explains a proposed modification to the SUS to provide an adjective rating that correlates with a given score, and provides details of what constitutes an acceptable SUS score.

@article{Korhonen2009,
abstract = {It has been commonly acknowledged that the acceptance of a product depends on both its utilitarian and non-utilitarian properties. The non-utilitarian properties can elicit generally pleasurable and particularly playful experiences in the product's users. Product design needs to improve the support of playful experiences in order to fit in with the users' multi-faceted needs. However, designing for fun and pleasure is not an easy task, and there is an urgent need in user experience research and design practices to better understand the role of playfulness in overall user experience of the product. In this paper, we present an initial framework of playful experiences which are derived from studies in interactive art and videogames. We conducted a user study to verify that these experiences are valid. We interviewed 13 videogame players about their experiences with games and what triggers these experiences. The results indicate that the players are experiencing the videogames in many different ways which can be categorized using the framework. We propose that the framework could help the design of interactive products from an experience point of view and make them more engaging, attractive, and most importantly, more playful for the users.},

abstract = {The field of interaction design encompasses a variety of methods for fostering innovation and creativity. In this paper, we present a selection of such methods that scaffold ideation and concept development in the early phases of design. As a conceptual frame for discussing these methods, we introduce four aspects that are particularly salient in the field of interaction design: tradition and transcendence, convergence and divergence, degree of structure, and sources of inspiration. We then outline how the methods relate to each of these aspects. The paper contributes to design practitioners by providing an overview of the methods and insights into when and how they may be employed to foster creativity and innovation in the design process; with regards to design research, the main contribution of the paper lies in the establishment and discussion of the four aspects as a frame for analyzing and comparing design methods},

@article{Brandt2004,
abstract = {In recent years both companies and research communities call for collaborative work practices and user-centered approaches in various design fields. There are several challenges and issues to take into consideration. For instance there is a need to find ways of collaborating across various competences, interests, responsibilities and perhaps professional languages both within one organization, between several organizations and between the organizations and a group of (potential) users. It is necessary to find ways to learn about users and the contexts of use, and to create a common understanding of the development task. This paper presents a set of four design games, which offers solutions to the challenges mentioned. The design games have been developed in the Space Studio during several projects and years. Here experiences are discussed on the basis of two research projects carried out in collaboration with industrial partners and potential users, and use of the games in three educational settings.The overall aim of the design games is to help facilitate a user-centered design process for cross-disciplinary design groups early in the design process. Framing collaborative design activities in a game format, arguably improves idea generation and communication between stakeholders. By shifting focus to the game, power relations and other factors that might hamper idea generation, are downplayed.},

The aim of this paper is to develop a design philosophy for slow technology, to discuss general design principles and to revisit some basic issues in interaction design from a more philosophical point of view. We discuss examples of soniture and informative art as instances of slow technology and as examples of how the design principles can be applied in practice.},

In this paper, we examine the productive role of material design artefacts in participatory design events. First, we offer a theoretical foundation for understanding material artefacts in design, based on pragmatist philosophy. Then, we employ this theoretical perspective to analyse a case in which a range of physical design materials was employed to envision and explore a projected building, the “Urban Media Space” a new library in Aarhus, Denmark. Drawing on examples from this case, we define a series of design considerations for employing material design artefacts in collaborative design events. Our contribution is valuable both in advancing the theoretical standpoint of interaction design in general, and in allowing participatory design practitioners to reflect on their use of material design artefacts when involving users.},

Through a study of group design sessions, we find images can provide access to rationale, moments of inspiration can be balanced with rationale, and differences between images and rationale must be reconciled. We conclude with thoughts on how such artifacts might be leveraged by the design community.},

Circumstances have just recently made possible the realization of that ambition.2 But the work has been started only within the past year. Consequently, if you are expecting answers based upon new empirical re- search you will be disappointed. What I can do at this time is to describe the plans for that re- search and to report the results of considerable thinking, including the hypotheses at which my students and I have arrived after a survey of the field and its problems. The research design, al- though not essentially new, should be of some in- terest. I will also point out some implications of the problems of creativity in vocational and edu- cational practices.},

Participants were instructed to control an aircraft-shaped cursor navigating in a virtual tunnel and to answer questions about the environment. The results confirmed that global awareness performance decreased with increased egocentricity in the display frame of reference. The two tethered displays (dynamic and rigid) supported the best local guidance performance. No significant performance differences were found between the two tethered displays.},
