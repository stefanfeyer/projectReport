\chapter*{Abstract}

Motor learning is an important aspect to master physical movements and usually includes a teacher. If a teacher is not available or affordable, Virtual Reality has proven to be be suitable replacement for a real teacher. In the real world the visual perspective on the teacher is natively exo-centric. In Virtual Reality the perspective on the guidance visualisation can be ego-centric, too. 
However, the influence of the visual perspective on virtual guidance visualisations is sparsely researched.
This report describes the design and implementation of E(x\textbar g)o, a system capable to conduct a study to investigate the influence of different visual perspectives on guidance visualisations. E(x\textbar g)o uses Virtual Reality and full body tracking for motor learning from multiple visual perspectives.
