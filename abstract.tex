\chapter*{Abstract}
Motor learning includes a teacher that a student can mimic. In case a teacher is not available Mixed Reality systems proofed to be suitable for motor learning, too. There is many research in several aspects of motor learning in Mixed Reality. But the influence of the visual perspective on a guidance evaluation has not be considered much. E(x\textbar g)o is a system designed to fill this research gap, providing different perspectives on guidance visualisations. With E(x\textbar g)o a study can be conducted to investigate the influence of visual perspectives on guidance visualisations for motor learning.
